    <p>A proton is a nuclear particle having a positive charge equal to that of the electron and a mass more than 1800 times that of the electron. 
        The atomic number is therefore the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. The neutron is a nuclear particle having a mass almost identical
         to that of the proton but no electric charge. The mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus.
